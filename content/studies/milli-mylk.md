# Quantifying the environmental impacts of making a new plant-based mylk. Guiding founders toward attainable climate actions today with a long-term strategy for improvements.

The founders of [milli mylk](https://millimylk.com/) know that the product life cycle of their freeze-dried almond mylk is different from the rest. As founders, they also want to build a responsible brand that is accountable to both people and the planet.

    The milli mylk team partnered with Seaborne to better understand the environmental impacts of producing their one-of-a-kind plant mylk, and to start taking thoughtful, informed action toward environmental responsibility.

The milli team was curious if using freeze-drying in mylk production (a process that improves flavor and convenience) might also offer climate benefits, like lower total CO₂ emissions. **We used science-backed methods to get them an honest answer.**

# Science-backed methods for honest climate accounting

Using the software package [OpenLCA](https://www.openlca.org/), we built an analytical model to quantify milli mylk product CO₂ emissions from Cradle-to-Consumer. That is, everything from growing the ingredients to delivering a box of mylk to a customer.

Through our analysis, we helped the milli team understand exactly where most CO₂ emissions occur in their supply chains and manufacturing processes.

Our Almond mylk is a complex product with global supply chains and multiple production phases.  Utilizing a variety of publicized and peer reviewed journals/studies, Seaborne analyzed and produced a beginning to end computation of our emissions to help us accurately offset our carbon emissions.

With careful research, our team was also able to identify a published LCA study for other almond mylks that helped us understand and prove that Milli has **`3x lower CO₂ emissions per serving` than other fresh almond mylks** when analyzed using the “Cradle-to-Consumer” scope that we explained above.

# Actionable, attainable sustainability strategies

Equipped with this information, our strategists at Seaborne worked closely with the milli founders to develop an attainable, three-part sustainability strategy for milli. This strategy covers actions to be taken “now, soon and later” – bearing in mind that sustainability is an ongoing process and mindset, not a one-time event.

That strategy covers actions to be taken immediately, like purchasing high-quality carbon offsets to cover 100% of emissions from making their almond mylk. The milli team also set some internal goals around how and when to reduce emissions in their manufacturing processes.

# A clear and compelling story

With science-backed results and a clear sustainability strategy in hand, we engaged our team of designers and developers to tell milli’s sustainability story. We collaboratively designed and developed a new webpage to house milli’s sustainability stats and stories, which you can check out [here](https://millimylk.com/pages/sustainability).

>> *"As an added benefit, their team of designers and developers are able to fully realize the data in a digestible and product driven approach. Simply put, they’re bringing forth a fresh approach to scientifically offsetting carbon emissions."* - Caleb F, milli mylk co-founder

### Our work with milli spanned analysis to design and we brought meaningful results. The milli team is informed and engaged in the ongoing process of becoming a more sustainable business, and this work tells a clear and compelling story for the brand to share with customers.
