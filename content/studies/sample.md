# Investigating the climate impacts of a mobile phone. Building a novel checkout feature to invite customers into the sustainability conversation.

*italic* **bold** __underline__ soaiddaWe worked with a mobile phone company called Light Phone to dive head first into the environmental footprint of their flagship product, the Light Phone II. As a ‘lightweight LCA’ investigation, we started with processing all the material inputs of the phone, and translating this into component level impact categories. With climate impact as our main focus, we saved time and money by focusing on the areas of the device that we knew would have the greatest embedded emissions across different lifecycle phases.
