# Investigating the climate impacts of a mobile phone, and building a novel checkout feature to invite customers into the sustainability conversation.

We worked with a mobile telecom company called Light Phone to dive head first into the environmental footprint of their flagship product, the Light Phone II. Climate impact was our primary focus — so we started by researching and understanding each “phase of life” the product goes through; and next, worked to translate each sub-component on the circuit board into broad impact categories, allowing us to measure each component and develop a sense of the overall impact for the device.

## Our Lightweight LCA Approach

In order to keep our process light and simple, we developed a light-weight approach to taking inventory of all of the processes and parts that make up the device. We worked through each of these emission events to develop an inventory on a per unit basis, and carefully documented ever decision process in a detailed report that the Light Phone team published on medium

**The outcome:** our (conservative) estimate for the embodied carbon in each Light Phone device was found to be `60.6 kg CO2e`, from manufacturing, fulfillment and electricity usage, all the way through to end of life.

## Consumer Education and Storytelling

Part of any successful environmental strategy is a resonant and legible approach to talking about the work. So, we set out to tell that story; so that the Light Phone’s customers could quickly understand how the device compares to it’s competitors, and other lifestyle choices.

We worked with Joe from the Light Phone team, who’s signature illustration style we incorporated into some key graphics that broke down the carbon footprint and made our work easy to digest for a casual consumer.

## Carbon Offsetting at Point of Purchase

> ## To date, we’ve sold over 6000 offsets at an opt-in rate of roughly ~40% per device.
> In order to mitigate the device’s impact, the Light Phone group chose to split a carbon offset 50/50 with their consumer, as an add-on during the checkout process. Carbon offsets are woefully underpriced in today’s carbon market, so we chose to price our offsets at $100 per ton (6 - 10x the going rate), which resulted in an additional $3.15 cost to the consumer.

# On the day we launched this initiative, the Light Phone had their best sales day to date.

Using our consumer education piece, we are able to legitimize our research, and help the consumer understand the integrity of our offsetting program.
