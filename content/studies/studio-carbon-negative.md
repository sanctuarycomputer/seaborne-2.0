# Our sibling studio, Sanctuary Computer had one goal. Understand and mitigate their environmental impact, so they could begin to lead their clients and peers in doing the same.

We worked with NYC’s Sanctuary Computer (our sibling studio @ [garden3d](https://www.garden3d.net/)) to develop a simple and easy to use approach to measuring their carbon emissions. As a client services business, they don’t produce a physical product, and for that reason, the don’t have the same size impact under their supply chain as similar sized product companies.

## Corporate Sustainability & the GHG Protocol

Given Sanctuary Computer doesn’t have a supply chain; we chose to focus our attention on the company’s corporate sustainability strategy. That means understanding all of the sources of emissions in their day-to-day operations.

We chose to use the Greenhouse Gas Protocol to measure impact. This involved working with each team member to calculate their individual energy consumption via their laptops, commutes, and modes of transport. At the time we started working together, Sanctuary was full time in-person in their NYC studio, so we studied everything down

Finally — we worked through their data transfer and cloud computing needs. This turned out to be the most challenging portion of the work:

## Transparency & Open Source

It’s been clear since day one that Sanctuary Computer’s carbon footprint is relatively small when compared to the emissions impact of their clients; so rather than focus too heavily on their individual footprint, we instead worked with the team using their new-found fluency in the subject to design and build a microsite that celebrates their work; and helps similar agencies do the same.

The result — [Studio Carbon Negative](https://negative.sanctuary.computer/) — a storytelling asset that empowers similar creative studios starting to get involved in climate action to speak confidently about environmental impact with their clients, too.

Additionally, Sanctuary Computer & garden3d also release a yearly environmental report; detailing their progress with goal setting, and describing the steps they took each year; further holding them accountable in a public square, and giving momentum to keep building on their work.
